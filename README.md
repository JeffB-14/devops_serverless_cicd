## Serverless CI/CD on the AWS Cloud

This example builds a serverless CI/CD environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, to provide an enterprise-ready, dynamic deployment pipeline for your serverless applications.

It is for users who want to get started in developing serverless applications on AWS, need an enterprise-ready deployment pipeline, and want to reduce the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with building, managing, and securing their own, custom-built deployment pipeline. 

After you prepare separate AWS accounts for development, production, and shared services, you can use the AWS CloudFormation templates provided here to set up the CI/CD environment in about 20 minutes.

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
The example includes a minimal sample serverless application that uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM).
